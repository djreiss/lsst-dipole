* There is a degeneracy in dipole fitting between closely-separated
  dipoles from bright sources and widely-separated dipoles from faint
  sources. [Here](notebooks/simple%202-d%20dipole%20plotting%20-%20more%20realistic%20noise_files/simple%202-d%20dipole%20plotting%20-%20more%20realistic%20noise_2_0.png) is an example.
